Get Reservation
-In this functionality we would return the details of the reservation done
-We will use sql joins in LINQ to retreive the particular fields we want details of

Get Reservation Details through an id
-Same as above functionality just that we will add where in LINQ query i.e where reservation.Id == id
-We first enclose the entire query in FirstOrDefault method
