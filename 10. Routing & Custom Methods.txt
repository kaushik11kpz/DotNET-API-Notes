-If we have two method which accepts same type of request like both methods accept [HttpGet("{id}")] this attribute. There will be AmbiguousException at the browser
-This issue will be solved via Attribute Routing

-[HttpGet("[action]/{id}")] we will use this attribute. Here [action] is the method name used in the url
-So, the path will be - api/Movies/Test/5
