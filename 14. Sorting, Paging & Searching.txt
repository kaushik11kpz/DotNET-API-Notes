Sorting Overview
-In this module we are going to look at sorting and filtering in ASP.NET Core Web API

Implementing Sorting
-We will use a switch statement and a parameter in GetAllMovies(string sort) method
-If sort="desc", we will return movies with rating in descending order
-If sort="asc", we will return movies with rating in ascending order

Paging Overview
-We cannot send the all tones of data to consumer 
-We need to slice it down
-Slice the data into pieces before sharing known as Paging
-Implement Paging in Web API

Implement Paging
-We will use Paging inside GetAllMovies method
-To implement Paing
1-Provide Page Number - The purpose of Page Number is that from which page we are going to retrieve the data
2.Provide Page size - The purpose of page size is to show the number of record on one page
3.Get all data from databse 
- _dbContext.Movies()
4.Apply the simple skip and take algorithm to get specific result 
- movies.Skip((pageNumber-1)*pageSize).Take(pageSize);
-First we will pass two parameter inside method pageNumber and pageSize
-Then we will get record from database
-Skip will skill the parameter of record and show the number of record o the next page
-We can also use default values for pageSize


Searching Overview
-Search functionality in Web API

Implement Searching
-In this lesson we will implemtn the search functionality in our Web API
-To achieve it, we need a Get method in which we will provide movie name and on behalf of that movie name, we will get the search results
-we will use LINQ query from GetAllMovies method and we will use where clause to implement search functionality
-to check if each particular movie starts with a letter/movieName provided in the parameter
